### Coin burn in cryptocurrencies means sending some of the coins of native cryptocurrency or some other currency to a public address from which those particular coins can never be spent because the private keys of such an address are unobtainable.


## All coins sent to the burn address are not recoverable and therefore removed from circulation.
